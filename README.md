##Framework Used:
###JavaScript, CSS, HTML

##Motivation:
###I built this as my first published web application as a student at General Assembly. This project was completed almost entirely through JavaScript and CSS.

##Features:
###Traditional memory matching games hinges on pattern recognition and memory recall.
###Test-Your-Memery! adds a twist whereby pattern recognition is hindered by none-repeating item pairs that invokes reference association. Combine it all with some humor, this game will challenge your working memory in three ways!
